# Project Name
Spider net
An AI that recognizes common spiders and identify them for you


## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 
This project has been run 1000 epochs of time so it has the most accurate results since the data set is relatively small, you can input about any photo of one of these spiders and It will recognize it with a guaranteed accuracy of 90 or higher.

## Running this project

Step 1. You are going to wanna open the keras file and reference the two files in it.
Step 2. Add the image that you want to scan and you're done!

##Liberies That it includes

 keras.models
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
 tensorflow
 numpy as np
 argparse
